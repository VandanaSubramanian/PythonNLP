# PythonNLP
This Python project implements a basic natural language processing (NLP) model that can analyze and classify text samples based on linguistic features. It compares unknown text against two known sources (e.g., Pete Davidson vs. Donald Trump) and predicts which source the unknown text is more likely to resemble.
